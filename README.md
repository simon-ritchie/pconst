# pconst
"pconst" library provide you const-like function on Python.

NOTE: currently developing status.

# For test

Test will be run by nose library (https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```
# pip install nose
```

Probably this pip command requires "Run as Administrator".

Then move to pconst directory, and run following command:

```
$ nosetests -s
```
